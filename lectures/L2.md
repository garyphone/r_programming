# Control Structures

Control structures in R allow you to control the flow of execution of the program,
depending on runtime conditions. Common structures are

* `if, else`: testing a conditions

* `for`: execute a loop a fixed number of times

* `while`: execute a loop while a condition is true

* `repeat`: execute an infinite loop

* `next`: skip an interation of a loop

* `return`: exit a function

Most control structures are not used in interactive sessions, but rather when 
writting functions or longer expressions.
