# Control Structures

## Introduction

Control structures in R allow you to control the flow of execution of the program,
depending on runtime conditions. Common structures are

* `if, else`: testing a conditions

* `for`: execute a loop a fixed number of times

* `while`: execute a loop while a condition is true

* `repeat`: execute an infinite loop

* `next`: skip an interation of a loop

* `return`: exit a function

Most control structures are not used in interactive sessions, but rather when 
writting functions or longer expressions.

## if-else 

**if**

```
if(<condition>) {
	## do something
} else {
	## do something
}

if(<condition>) {
	## do something
} else if(<condition2>)	{
	## do something different
} else {
	## do something different
}
```

Of course, the else clause is not necessary.

```
if(<condition>) {

} 

if(<condition2>) {

}
```

## for loops

**for**

`for` loops take an interator variable and assign it successive values from a sequence or vector.
For loops are most commonly used for iterating over the elements of an object (list, vector, etc.).

```
for (i in 1:10) {
	print(i)
}
```

This loop takes the `i` variable and in each iteration of the loop gives it values 1, 2, 3,..., 10, 
and then exits.

**Nested for loops**

`for` loops can be nested.

```
x <- matrix(1:6, 2, 3)

for (i in seq_len(nrow(x))) {
	for (j in seq_len(ncol(x))) {
		print(x[i,j])
	}
}
```

Be careful with nesting though. Nesting beyond 2-3 levels is ofen very difficult to read/understand.

## while loops

**while**

While loops begin by testing a condition. If it is true, then they execute the loop body. Once the 
loop body is executed, the condition is tested again, and so forth.

```
count <- 0
while (count < 10) {
	print(count)
	count <- count +1
}
```

While loops can potentially result in infinite loops if not written properly. Use with care!

Sometimes there will be more than on condition in the test. Conditions are always evaluated from left to right.

## repeat, next, break

**repeat**

Repeat initiates an infinite loop; there are not commonly used in statistical applications but they do have their
uses. The only way to exit a `repeat` loop is to call `break`.

```
x0 <- 1
tol <- 1e-8

repeat {
	x1 <- computeEstimate()
	
	if (abs(x1 - x0) < tol) {
		break
	} else {
		x0 <- x1
	}
}
```

The loop in the previous is a bit dangerous because there is no guarantee it will stop.
Better to set a hard limit on the number of iterations (e.g. using a for loop) and then 
report whether convergence was achieved or not.

**next, return**

`next` is used to skip an iteration of a loop

```
for (i in 1:100) {
	if (i <= 20) {
		## Skip the first 20 iterations
		next
	}
	## Do something here
}		
```

`return` signals that a function should exit and return a given value.

**Summary**

* Control structures like `if`, `while`, and `for` allow you to control the flow of an R program.

* Infinite loops should generally be avoided, even if they are theoretically correct.

* Control structures mentioned here are primarily useful for writting program; for command-line
interactive work, the *apply function are more useful.
