# Simulation and Profiling

## Simulation

**Generating Random Numbers**

Functions for probability distributions in R

* `rnorm`: generate random Normal variates with a given mean and standard deviation

* `dnorm`: evaluate the Normal probability density (with a given mean/SD) at a point
(or vector of points)

* `pnorm`: evaluate the cumulative distribution function for a Normal distribution

* `rpois`: generate random Poisson variates with a given rate

Probability distribution functions usually have four functions associated with them. 
Then functions are prefixed with and

* `d` for density

* `r` for random number generation

* `p` for cumulative distribution

* `q` for quantile function

If $\Phi$ is the cumulative distribution function for a standard Normal distribution, then
`pnorm(q)` = $\Phi(q)$ and `qnorm(p)` = $\Phi^{-1}(p)$.

Setting the random number seed with `set.seed` ensures reproducibility

Always set the random number seed when conducting a simulation!

**Generating Random Numbers From a Linear Model**

Suppose we want to simulate from the following linear model

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon
$$

where $\epsilon \sim N (0, 2^2)$. Assume $x \sim N (0, 1^2)$, $\beta_0 = 0.5$ and $\beta_1 = 2$.

```
> set.seed(20)
> x <- rnorm(100)
> e <- rnorm(100, 0, 2)
> y <- 0.5 + 2 * x + e
```

What if `x` is binary?

```
> set.seed(10)
> x <- rbinom(100, 1, 0.5)
> e <- rnorm(100, 0, 2)
> y <- 0.5 + 2 * x + e
```


Suppose we want to simulate from a Poisson model where

$$
Y \sim Poisson(\mu) \quad log (\mu) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x
$$

and $\beta_0 = 0.5$, $\beta_1 = 0.3$. We need to use the `rpois` function for this

```
> x <- rnorm(100)
> log.mu <- 0.5 + 0.3 * x
> y <- rpois(100, exp(log.mu)) 
```

**Random Sampling**

The `sample` function draws randomly from a specified set of (scalar) objects allowing you to sample
from arbitrary distributions.

**Summary**

* Drawing samples from specific probability distributions can be donw with `r*` functions

* Standard distributions are built in: Normal, Poisson, Binomial, Exponential, Gamma, etc.

* The `sample` function can be used to draw random samples from arbitrary vectors

* Setting the random number generator seed via `set.seed` is critical for reproducibility

## R Profiler

**Why is My Code So Slow**

* Profiling is a systematic way to examine how much time is spend in different parts of a program

* Useful when trying to optimize your code

* Often code runs fine once, but what if you have to put it in a loop for 1,000 iterations? Is it still
fast enough?

* Profiling is better than guessing

**On Optimizing Your Code**

* Getting biggest impact on speeding up code depends on knowing where the code spends most of its time

* This can not be done without performance analysis or profiling

**General Principles of Optimization**

* Design first, then optimize

* Remember: Premature optimization is the root of all evil

* Measure (collect data), do not guessing

* If you are going to be scientist, you need to apply the same principles here!

**Using system.time()**

* Takes an arbitrary R expression as input (can be wrapped in curly braces) and returns the amount
of time taken to evaluate the expression

* Computes the time (in seconds) needed to execute an expression. If there is an error, gives time 
until the error occured

* Return an object of class `proc_time`. **user time** is the time charged to the CPU(s) for this
expression. **elapsed time** is the "wall clock" time

* Usually, the user time and elapsed time are relatively close, for straight computing tasks

* Elapsed time may be greater than user time if the CPU spends a lot of time waiting around

* Elapsed time may be smaller than user time if your machine has multiple cores/processors (and is
capable of using them). 

**Beyond system.time()**

* Using `system.time()` allows you to test certain functions or code blocks to see if they are 
taking excessive amounts of time

* Assumes you already know where the problem is and can call `system.time()` on it

* What if you do not know where to start?

**The R Profiler**

* The `Rprof()` function starts the profiler in R. R must be compiled with profiler support (but this is
usually the case)

* The `summaryRprof()` function summarizes the output from `Rprof()` (otherwise it is not readable)

* DO NOT use `system.time()` and `Rprof()` together or you will be sad

* `Rprof()` keeps track of the function call stack at regularly sampled intervals and tabulates how
much time is spend in each function

* Default sampling interval is 0.02 seconds

* NOTE: If your code runs very quickly, the profiler is not useful, but then you probably do not need it
in that case.

**Using summaryRprof()**

* The `summaryRprof()` function tabulates the R profiler output and calculates how much time is spend in 
which function

* There are two methods for normalizing the data

* "by.total" divides the time spend in each function by the total run time

* "by.self" does the same but first subtracts out time spent in functions above in the call stack

**Summary**

* `Rprof()` runs the profiler for performance of analysis of R code

* `summaryRprof()` summarizes the output of `Rprof()` and gives percent of time spent in each function (with\
two types of normalization)

* Good to break your code into functions so that the profiler can give useful informnation about where time
is being spent

* C or Fortran code is not profiled.
