## Simulation

**Generating Random Numbers**

Functions for probability distributions in R

* `rnorm`: generate random Normal variates with a given mean and standard deviation

* `dnorm`: evaluate the Normal probability density (with a given mean/SD) at a point
(or vector of points)

* `pnorm`: evaluate the cumulative distribution function for a Normal distribution

* `rpois`: generate random Poisson variates with a given rate

Probability distribution functions usually have four functions associated with them. 
Then functions are prefixed with and

* `d` for density

* `r` for random number generation

* `p` for cumulative distribution

* `q` for quantile function

If $\Phi$ is the cumulative distribution function for a standard Normal distribution, then
`pnorm(q)` = $\Phi(q)$ and `qnorm(p)` = $\Phi^{-1}(p)$.

Setting the random number seed with `set.seed` ensures reproducibility

Always set the random number seed when conducting a simulation!
