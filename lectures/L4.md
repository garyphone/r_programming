# Simulation and Profiling

## Simulation

**Generating Random Numbers**

Functions for probability distributions in R

* `rnorm`: generate random Normal variates with a given mean and standard deviation

* `dnorm`: evaluate the Normal probability density (with a given mean/SD) at a point
(or vector of points)

* `pnorm`: evaluate the cumulative distribution function for a Normal distribution

* `rpois`: generate random Poisson variates with a given rate

Probability distribution functions usually have four functions associated with them. 
Then functions are prefixed with and

* `d` for density

* `r` for random number generation

* `p` for cumulative distribution

* `q` for quantile function

If $\Phi$ is the cumulative distribution function for a standard Normal distribution, then
`pnorm(q)` = $\Phi(q)$ and `qnorm(p)` = $\Phi^{-1}(p)$.

Setting the random number seed with `set.seed` ensures reproducibility

Always set the random number seed when conducting a simulation!

**Generating Random Numbers From a Linear Model**

Suppose we want to simulate from the following linear model

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon
$$

where $\epsilon \sim N (0, 2^2)$. Assume $x \sim N (0, 1^2)$, $\beta_0 = 0.5$ and $\beta_1 = 2$.

```
> set.seed(20)
> x <- rnorm(100)
> e <- rnorm(100, 0, 2)
> y <- 0.5 + 2 * x + e
```

What if `x` is binary?

```
> set.seed(10)
> x <- rbinom(100, 1, 0.5)
> e <- rnorm(100, 0, 2)
> y <- 0.5 + 2 * x + e
```


Suppose we want to simulate from a Poisson model where

$$
Y \sim Poisson(\mu) \quad log (\mu) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x
$$

and $\beta_0 = 0.5$, $\beta_1 = 0.3$. We need to use the `rpois` function for this

```
> x <- rnorm(100)
> log.mu <- 0.5 + 0.3 * x
> y <- rpois(100, exp(log.mu)) 
```

**Random Sampling**

The `sample` function draws randomly from a specified set of (scalar) objects allowing you to sample
from arbitrary distributions.

**Summary**

* Drawing samples from specific probability distributions can be donw with `r*` functions

* Standard distributions are built in: Normal, Poisson, Binomial, Exponential, Gamma, etc.

* The `sample` function can be used to draw random samples from arbitrary vectors

* Setting the random number generator seed via `set.seed` is critical for reproducibility
