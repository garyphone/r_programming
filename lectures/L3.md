# Loop Functions and Debugging

## Loop Functions

**Looping on the Command Line**

Writing for, while loops is useful when programming but not particularly easy when working
interactively on the command line. There are some functions which implement looping to make
life easier.

* `lapply`: Loop over a list and evaluate a function on each element

* `sapply`: Same as `lapply` but try to simplify the result

* `apply`: Apply a function over the margins of an array

* `tapply`: Apply a function over subsets of a vector

* `mapply`: Multivariante version of `lapply`

An auxiliary function `split` is also useful, particularly in conjunction with `lapply`.

**lapply**

`lapply` takes three arguments: (1) a list `x`; (2) a function (or the name of a function) `FUN`;
(3) other arguments via its ... argument. If `x` is not a list, it will be coereced to a list using
`as.list`

`lapply` always returns a list, regardless of the class of the input.

`lapply` and friends make heavy use of anonymous functions.

An anonymous function for extracting the first column of each matrix.

**sapply**

`sapply` will try to simplify the result of `lapply` if possible.

* If the result is a list where every element is length 1, then a vector is returned

* If the result is a list where every element is a vector of the same length (>1), a matrix is returned 

* If it can not figure things out, a list is returned
